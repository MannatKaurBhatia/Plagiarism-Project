## PLAGIARISM DETECTION PROJECT

**Overview**

This project utilizes AI and ML techniques to detect plagiarism among text files. The process involves importing necessary libraries, loading the text files, preprocessing the data, extracting features, calculating similarity scores, and evaluating the project using a covariance matrix. The overall accuracy achieved by this project is 95%.

**Project Steps**

**1. Preprocessing Text**
- **Task**: Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation, digits, and stop words.
  
**2. Feature Extraction**
- **Task**: Convert the cleaned text into vectors using TF-IDF.

**3. Similarity Calculation (Cosine Similarity)**
- **Task**: Calculate the similarity scores between the text files.

**4. Threshold Setting**
- **Task**: Set a threshold to determine plagiarism based on similarity scores.

**5. Main Execution**
- **Task**: Load text files, preprocess data, extract features, calculate similarity, and detect plagiarism.

**Results**
- **Accuracy**: The project achieved an overall accuracy of 95%.
- **Plagiarized Pairs**: The code prints pairs of text files that are detected as plagiarized based on the similarity threshold.

**Conclusion***
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to plagiarism detection using text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and similarity calculation using cosine similarity. The high accuracy rate highlights the effectiveness of the implemented techniques.
